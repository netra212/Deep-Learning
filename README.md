# 🚀 Deep Learning Repository  

Welcome to my **Deep Learning Repository**, where I explore, implement, and experiment with various deep learning models and techniques. This repo contains tutorials, research papers, and hands-on projects using **TensorFlow** and **PyTorch**.  

## 📌 Contents  
- 🔹 **Fundamentals of Deep Learning** (Tensors, Backpropagation, Optimization)  
- 🔹 **Neural Networks** (MLP, CNN, RNN, Transformers)  
- 🔹 **Computer Vision** (Object Detection, Image Segmentation)  
- 🔹 **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** (Text Classification, BERT, GPT)  
- 🔹 **Generative Models** (GANs, VAEs)  
- 🔹 **Reinforcement Learning** (DQN, PPO, A3C)
