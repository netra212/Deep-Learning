# Perceptron: Mathematical functionor or models which works on the supervised ML. 
- Perceptron is a line in 2D space which create a region in order to divide the dataset into two classes means, peceptron performs the binary classification. 
- In 2D - Perceptron acts as a Line. 
- In 3D - Perceptron acts as a Plane.

# Limitations of Perceptrons:
- Perceptron only works on linear data or the sort of linear data. 
- Perceptorn will fails on the completly non-linear data.
